# Door-Locker-Security-System
Description:
1) Human Machine Interface (HMI) module for an access control system using an AVR microcontroller
programmed in C. The module facilitates user interaction through a keypad and displays feedback on a Liquid
Crystal Display (LCD). Key functionalities include entering and changing passwords, displaying status messages
during door operations, and triggering alarms for security breaches. The system ensures secure access by
verifying passwords with the Control Unit and implements measures such as password matching and alarm
activation for unauthorized access attempts.
2) Control Unit module responsible for all processing and decision-making in an access control system using an
AVR microcontroller programmed in C. The module interfaces with the Human Machine Interface (HMI) to
manage functionalities such as password checking, door operation, and alarm activation. It communicates with
the HMI via UART and controls peripheral devices including an EEPROM for password storage, a DC motor for
door operation, and a buzzer for alarm signaling. The system ensures secure access by validating passwords and
implementing security measures such as alarm activation for unauthorized access attempts.
